Git Knowledge Summary
**********************

1. Three Git Area
- Modified  : If a file has been modified, but not yet added (git add) to staging, it is in Modified area;
- Staging   : All files that have been "git add", but not yet commited (git commit). There are shown as a list of green file names, and are 
              waiting to be commited;
- Committed : All files that have been commited by "git commit";

2. 'git status' shows files in both Modified and staged area.

3. How to un-stage a added file?
After you "git add" a file (the filename has become green), and the you want to undo this operation, you use command line:
---------------------------
git restore --staged <file>
---------------------------
to undo this. Then the file would be in Modified aread again, with filename red.
